Assignment P1

The project turned out successful. Although we were under a time crunch, 
the project itself did not seem too difficult.  However, our largest 
concern was fixing the errors that were given by the junit tests run on 
the CList program. It showed errors, but since we did not know what tests 
were run, we did not know what the errors even were. We had to guess 
around and fix random things which we weren't sure were wrong or not. A 
suggestion would be splitting part A and B into different deadlines to 
make sure that people are keeping up with the tasks. Having a set 
assignment would also help since it kept fluctuating as the deadline came 
closer, changing our interpretation of the assignment. We didn't have 
enough time to thoroughly optimize the simP.txt, but we tied with 
sim1.txt.
